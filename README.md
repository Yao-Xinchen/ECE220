# ECE 220 MPs in CMake

ECE 220 ZJUI FA2023

Written by Yao Xinchen, Dec 2023

## Intro

This project is a CMake version of the ECE 220 course at UIUC.

Original ECE 220 MPs are built with Makefile. \
The recommended editor in the course is VSCode.

Built with CMake, this project is hoped to be more easily debugged with CLion. \
Files can be organized in a more reasonable way.

> This project is only used for debugging. \
> You need to copy your code to the original MP folder for submission.
